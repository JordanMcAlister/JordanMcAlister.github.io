          <h2>Workouts ideas to get started</h2>
          <p>Physical activity is  mental, very much so that just getting yourself to workout (whatever workout activity it 
            is that you choose to do) requires a jolt of momentum. Every day “may” be into a  hassel if the 
            activity is thought out to be a “hassle” day to day. Not gonna lie, Workouts can be rough, although the 
            pay off is fantastic. Take note that workouts are not classified by one category only, rather by what you choose 
            to partake in. How about we submerge into Activities that are workouts by themselves that almost anybody can partake in. 
            However before I get into that I believe you should tie bodyweight workouts with these activities. Bodyweight exercises are a 
            superb way of building strength.<br><strong>BodyWeight Exercise</strong><br>Bodyweight exercise is a first choice because of the simple fact that it is free, accessible whether it's in 
          your house or outside, thus  literally  any season works. Guess what your first down payment is nothing unlike a gym 
          or a sport that requires an upfront investment. Calisthenic workouts are challenging, there’s no looking past that. In my opinion 
          weightlifting feels different, the burn is less intense, although you may feel differently. Literally work out any body part, re-search 
          exercises to switch up your load throughout the month changing up your workout helps diversify your weeks. Repetitive workouts for 
          around 2 months discouraged me from exercising consistently. Specific muscle groups lean more on pull or push workouts; Proper back 
          workout consists of a bar, however certain parks consist of  pull-up bars. Target sells home indoor pull-up-bars  
          which hooks to the threshold(I’ll let you do the research) of your door. you can always invest into some 
          resistance bands specifically  or  push up handles if you ever want to diversify your body workouts. of course before getting 
          into any sort of workout warm up the muscles first by stretching and running . I cannot Stress enough how important 
          Researching proper form is, especially if you're new to working out. Just like any other type of workout, ease your 
          way into a routine, therefore give yourself at least a month to adjust with beginner calisthenic exercises and observe your 
          Reps+Sets. Afterwards push into a mid-intensity workout until you transition into high intensity routines. Despite the information I give there 
          is information Im leaving out for you to read for yourself. I will produce specific information about weight and body 
          weight workouts in the future. This article’s produced for people confused about where to start working out. Otherwise a high 
          intensity from the beginning will result in overexertion of the muscles, thus your going to have intense muscle aches, 
          we will save that hassle for another Time.<br><strong>WeIghtlifting:</strong><br>Consider your goals, do you want to become big, just stay fit, or simply tone down. Am I motivated 
            to got to the gym by myself or do I need a push? Once you figure these out begin doing 
            a little bit of research into workouts, and examine how that workout is performed, how will this lead me to 
            my goals. Avoid entering the gym with half of an idea of how to properly perform an exercise and just 
            decide “oh I’m going to just do it anyway”, because this mentality is setting you up for injury. What I 
            did is watch videos over and over and practiced the form without weights beforehand, despite how much time it took 
            it helped me out. I even read some articles on how to perform a specific exercise. Remember to stretch properly 
            and run before hitting the gym. Stretching loosens your muscles up, hence the body feels mobile instead of stiff. Start 
            off lifting very light weights to warm up the muscles to whatever exercise you're performing or simply with no weights 
            at all (ALWAYS start off light... regardless if you stretched and ran before hand). Afterwards when your warmed up then 
            you may start slowly adding heavier weight to your exercise. The gym is great for those who want others working 
            around them. Take into consideration these gyms range in pricing, some companies charge low others charge high. Unless there is 
            a deal, you may need to pay a down fee plus a monthly rate.<br><strong>SOLO/GROUP EXERCISES:</strong><br>Outdoor exercises anyone with a mere ball can partake in include basketball soccer or volleyball, forget nets and goals. 
           Utilize the internet through Google maps to locate parks near you with a hoop or field and begin dribbling, layup, 
           shortstop shots. Apply training drill tutorials you learn from youtube. If you are not privileged to have a phone to 
           google maps then safely ask employees at stores directions to get to a park. Play ball with others, the best 
           thing that you can do to exert the most out of your muscles and learning new routines is to frequently 
           engage in games. So long as you actually participate and work at getting better, you will feel a greater workout. 
           Not everyone lives in great neighborhoods, therefore read the next paragraph below for solo activities. Take it one step at 
           a time. Your first week should not consist of playing like you’re a professional; However if you’re not a beginner 
           then you can train harder to your bodies needs. For Beginners Learn the very basics. Listen everybody gradually grows differently. 
           Analyze how professional athletes play or watch basketball youtube tutorials for beginners. I recommend changing up your motions when balling 
           because just like when you lift the same or do things in repetitive patterns you're more likely to become bored 
           and discouraged from engaging in that activity. Balls can be expensive so I suggest using amazon if you have internet 
           or a nearest target. Buy a rubber playground ball if you have to. Playground balls probably cost less than any 
           other balls, although a basketball soccer ball or volleyball are more suited for there specific sport..(The brand name balls 
           that is. You never know what you may get from a non-brand name ball). These team sports revolve around 
           push movements, because your frequently exploding off your feet and shooting kicking or hitting the ball away from you. Listen 
           the plus to these workouts is cardio, however replacing these activities for regular running and jogging is not recommended. Stretching and 
           warm up runs are staples before any other activity. Remember playing ball requires frequent stops along with hips and 
           leg rotations, hence sounds disastrous if your muscles were not warmed up ahead of time before performing these types of movements.<br><strong>SOLO:</strong><br>All right let's get into this, so for solo exercises honestly you've got hikes you've literally got biking  skateboarding 
          etc. Not all of these are as equally intense as the other, Rather some are more laid back forms of 
          exercise. Furthermore these are exercises that blend together with bodyweight exercises, because only one area of the body is emphasised 
          on while the other parts are not. For a healthy body you want everything worked on for a balanced healthy 
          body. Skateboards are sold on Amazon or Target or skateboard shops. Bikes as well are sold at amazon, Target, and 
          bike shops. Hikes you will need a to safely locate a spot on your own. Again personally I feel that 
          any of these exercises should be followed up with body weight exercises.<br>Get out of your head if you want to start working on a fit lifestyle. If you’re new to 
          an exercise remember to start slow and build your way up, do not overwhelm yourself with too much. There is
